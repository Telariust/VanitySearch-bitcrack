# VanitySearch-bitcrack
VanitySearch, v1.15.4, fork, fix - bitcrack
 
Maximum compatible with the original BitCrack project (https://github.com/brichard19/BitCrack).

MultiGPU and more faster (+25% thanks to symmetry to calculate batch inversion). 

th128gr, th256gr, th512gr - its constant NB_TRHEAD_PER_GROUP in GPUEngine.h

th128gr - origin src, but modern gpu work better for th256gr or th512gr. try experimentally.
